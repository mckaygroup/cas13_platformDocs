4. Experimental design
=======================
.. note::

    This section requires the filtered table as the input from a single genus/subgenus 


UI of the experimental Design
------------------------------
The analysis section is divided into several sub-sections. 

- Upload the Guide table
- Add in Adaptors 
- Sequence (nt and protein)

Uploaded files
--------------

Ensure that the user can see that their file has been uploaded to do either the 'adaptor' or x experimental design consideration

Add in Adaptors
---------------

If the research is wanting to use the x experimental approach, they can automate adding in their required adaptors to the sequence

Sequence (nt and protein)
--------------------------

This section aims to extract the protein coding genes for any given guide. This links back to the original sequence data base and extracts either the whole gene or a 150bp snippet
