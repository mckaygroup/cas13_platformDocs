2. Engine: Processing the Sequence data
=======================================

This process uses R scripts 

.. note:: 
    Prerequisite
        - Sequences and required data already processed from the backend 


1. Extract pattern
	extract the 30bp segment (modular length)
	Apply biological rule (3' CC == 5' GG)
2. Hamming distance
	tested in both R and Cpp (Cpp is faster ~40min for 200K GG based guides)
	In blocks of 25 guides to keep the process speedy
3. Mergin the hamming distance
4. Exact Conservation
5. Relaxed Conservation (uses output of 3 to reduce list)
6. Annotating
7. Reverse Complement
8. Add in ML predictions
9. Add in Reporter results
10. Off-target effects
