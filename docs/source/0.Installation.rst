Overview
========


This process is to install the required packages for running the pipeline. 


------------------------------------------------------------------

Please install R version 4.5 or greater. If your operating system doesn't support this version of R, than some of the functions (e.g., annotation with scGate) may not work as expected. 

MAC:
^^^^

* Install `R_mac <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/>`_ 
* Install `RStudio <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>`_
* Install `Quartz <https://www.xquartz.org>`_

Windows:
^^^^^^^^

* Install `R.Windows <https://cran.r-project.org>`_
* Install `RStudio <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>`_
* Install `Rtools <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>`_

Linux:
^^^^^^

* install `R.linux <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/fullREADME.html>`_

using **sudo apt install** the following:
libcurl, libfontconfig1, libtiff5, liblapack-dev, libblas-dev, libglpk-dev, libudunits2-dev, libgdal-dev libgeos-dev, libproj-dev
and also the gfortran


Sytem requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Recommended to use a 64-bit OS with at least 16GB of RAM, ideally >=32GB. This is needed for the memory intensive merging and annotation steps. 

When running STEGO.R merging and annotation steps, we recommend to limit the number of other running programs to help prevent RAM memory overflow, espeically if you have <32Gb of RAM. 

Storage requirements will depend on the number of cells annotating. For example, at least 200 GB of free space on a Macbook Pro was needed to process the T cell Atlas (V2/V3). 

short-cut key for running a line of R code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   put the cursor on the line you want to run. 

        Mac: Command shift Enter
        Windows: ctrl shift Enter

Downloading and installing STEGO.R
----------------------------------

Follow the steps in the **install.R** file found in the **Directory_for_Project**


:: 

      # see https://stegor-documents.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html for more details on the tutorial to follow through.
      # This is to make sure with installing from source is set to the g++ compiler
      Sys.setenv("CXX" = "g++")
      
      # installing STEGO.R
      if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
        install.packages("BiocManager")
      
      if (!require("devtools", quietly = TRUE))
        install.packages("devtools")
      
      if (!require("usethis", quietly = TRUE))
        install.packages("usethis")
      
      # install STEGO.R with Devtools
      # if you get asked about installing from SOURCE, select NO.
      # if asked about updating the packages, select either 1 for all, or 3 for none.
      # also run this line to check for updates
      devtools::install_github("KerryAM-R/STEGO.R")
      
      # if asked to update the app either select 1 to updated all
      1
      # if asked to install from source on the M1 Mac chip (Seurat)
      y
      
      # if then prompted with all the bioconductor based packages to install from source on M1 or greater Mac chip
      y
      
      # under development - latest build, but may be unstable
      # devtools::install_github("KerryAM-R/STEGO.R", ref = "beta-version", force = T)
      
      # import all of the fonts to your system. Will only need to be done the first time.
      require(extrafont)
      font_import()
      
      # when it asks if you would like to install the different fonts
      y
      
      loadfonts()
      
      fonts <- fonttable()
      head(fonts)
      
      # you many need to add in the git_token, and the Renviorn is opened with the following code.
      usethis::edit_r_environ()


**Possible installing prompts**

:: 

   When you see this line: "These packages have more recent versions available. It is recommended to update all of them. Which would you like to update?"
   
   Answer with  "1" and hit "Enter". 


**Other Mac prompts on M1 or greater chip**

The installation may ask you the following to install from source. In this instance, select yes. 

::

     There is a binary version available but the source version is later:
      binary source needs_compilation
      Seurat  5.0.3  5.1.0              TRUE

      Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation? (Yes/no/cancel) 
      y
      

**Installing the bioconductor packages from Source.**

::

      Packages which are only available in source form, and may need compilation of C/C++/Fortran: ‘zlibbioc’ ‘XVector’ ‘SparseArray’ ‘S4Arrays’ ‘IRanges’ ‘Biobase’ ‘DelayedArray’ ‘GenomicRanges’ ‘S4Vectors’
        ‘BiocNeighbors’ ‘BiocParallel’
      Do you want to attempt to install these from sources? (Yes/no/cancel) 
      y


**Expected final lines once STEGO.R has been correctly installed.**

Trouble shooting missing packages
---------------------------------
      
Check that you have the latest version of R. 

Check that you downloaded first the devtools and bioconductor.
